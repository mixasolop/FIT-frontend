    <h2>About Us!</h2>
    <p>
      We are students from WUT studying Computer Science in our second semester.
      Our goal with this project is to pass FIT with flying colours. The model is something we take great pride in,
      as some of us know some titbits of playing an instrument and are capable of learning more,
      but lacked proper tools â€” so we created them!
