      <b style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Music2Notes: Making Music Accessible</b><br>
We are a team of 8 WUT Computer Science students in our second semester who share a deep fascination with music. This passion drove us to develop a music-related project for our FIT course that addresses a common challenge.<br>
<br><b style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Our Project</b><br>
Our goal is straightforward yet powerful - to make learning music more accessible for everyone. Many of us have personally struggled when learning instruments like piano or guitar, not because of difficulty, but due to limited access to sheet music for songs we truly love.<br>
<br><b style="font-size: 1.4rem;">The Solution</b><br>
Music2Notes allows you to obtain sheet music for any mono-instrumental song just by uploading a recording. The app's intuitive interface ensures that anyone can use it without confusion. With our technology, your favorite melodies are no longer out of reach - playing the songs you love is now just a few clicks away.<br>
<br><b style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Our Technology</b><br>
The core of our project is our innovative sound processing algorithm. It works by analyzing the frequency of each second in a recording, carefully removing noise, and comparing the results with the frequencies of known musical notes. This enables our system to create accurate musical notation based entirely on sound input.<br>
Don't let limited sheet music availability stop you from enjoying your musical journey. With Music2Notes, the notes to your favorite songs are always at your fingertips!<br>
